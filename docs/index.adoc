== Overview

This is the technical documentation pages for link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp[the React4xp library], v(REACT4XP_VERSION).

*React4XP is an Enonic XP library with a companion build setup*, that:

- makes it easy to get started with rendering React from ordinary XP controllers - making JSX look like any other templating engine,
- is flexible enough to cover many more advanced use cases,
- features some tricks right out of the box to conveniently cover a couple of common needs:
  * isomorphic client- or serverside rendering and hydration,
  * build flow and compilation,
  * automated asset serving with optimization,
- aims to be modular and tweakable, making it possible to pop the hood, pick it apart and set things up your own way. Godspeed!

== API

See the link:api.html[React4xp API documentation]:

- link:api.html#_xp_controller_functions[XP controller functions]: Functions to use in XP controllers. They handle React4xp entries and render output HTML (`body`) and activating page contributions.
- link:api.html#_services[Services]: React4xp exposes some service endpoints to the client. These are central to running things in the client after the output from the XP controller: fetching the entry assets, their dependency chunks, and the client wrapper itself.
- link:api.html#_client_side_wrapper_api[Client-side wrapper]: Client-runnable code that wraps a few handy functions, most importantly `render` and `hydrate`.

The output from the controller functions use the services and the client wrapper, but they can both also be used as standalone functionality in the client.
